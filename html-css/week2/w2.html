<h4>examples of dramatic transformation in communication and commenrce led by web development include 

e-commerce. Online auction sites such as eBay have changed the way consumers find and purchase goods 

and services. Online retailers such as Amazon.com and Buy.com (among many others) have transformed the 

shopping and bargain-hunting experience for many consumers.

<h4>Since the commercialization of the web, web development has been a growing industry. The growth of 

this industry is being driven by businesses wishing to use their website to sell products and services 

to customers.[1] </h4>


<h4>There is open source of software for web development like berkeleyDB, GlassFish, LAMP (Linux, 

Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and Perl?Plack. This has kept the cost of growth of the industry has been the 

rise of easy-to use WYSIWYG web web-development software, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and 

Microsoft Visual Studio. Knowledge of Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) or of programming languages is 

still required to use such software, but the basics can be learned and implemented quickly with the 

help of help files, technical books, internet tutorials, or face-to-face training. </h4>


<h4>An ever-growing set of tools and technologies have helped developers build more dynamic and 

interactive websites. Further, web developers now help to deliver applications as web services which 

were traditionally only available as applications on a desk-based computer. This has allowed for many 

opportunities to decentralize information and media distribution. Examples can be seen with the rise of 

cloud services such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox and Google Docs.These web services allow users to 

interact with applications form many locations, web services allow users to interact with applications 

from many locations, instead of being tied to a specific workstation for their application 

environment.</h4>
