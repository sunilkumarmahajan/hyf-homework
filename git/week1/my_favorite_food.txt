garlic naan bread recipe
Crave It All here sharing our recipe for garlic naan bread; a favorite spin on a traditional flat bread from India. Normally baked inside hot Tandoor ovens with charcoal or wood fire, our naan bread recipe has been altered to cook them right on the stove in a hot cast-iron skillet.

We use a combination of yogurt and oil to give them an addictive soft and fluffy texture, and add minced garlic right into the dough to give us a perfect garlicky flavor.

Youâ€™ll be amazed watching them puff up into glorious breads right in front of you in seconds!
